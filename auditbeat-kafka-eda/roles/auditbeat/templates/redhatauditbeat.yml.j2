########################## Auditbeat Configuration #############################

# This is a reference configuration file documenting all non-deprecated options
# in comments. For a shorter configuration example that contains only the most
# common options, please see auditbeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/auditbeat/index.html

# ============================== Config Reloading ==============================

# Config reloading allows to dynamically load modules. Each file which is
# monitored must contain one or multiple modules as a list.
auditbeat.config.modules:

  # Glob pattern for configuration reloading
  path: ${path.config}/modules.d/*.yml

  # Period on which files under path should be checked for changes
  reload.period: 10s

  # Set to true to enable config reloading
  reload.enabled: false

# Maximum amount of time to randomly delay the start of a dataset. Use 0 to
# disable startup delay.
auditbeat.max_start_delay: 10s

# =========================== Modules configuration ============================
auditbeat.modules:

# The file integrity module sends events when files are changed (created,
# updated, deleted). The events contain file metadata and hashes.
- module: file_integrity
  paths:
  - /var/www/html

  # List of regular expressions to filter out notifications for unwanted files.
  # Wrap in single quotes to workaround YAML escaping rules. By default no files
  # are ignored.
  include_files:
  - 'index.html'

  exclude_files:
  - '(?i)\.sw[nop]$'
  - '~$'
  - '/\.git($|/)'

  # Scan over the configured file paths at startup and send events for new or
  # modified files since the last time Auditbeat was running.
  scan_at_start: true

  # Average scan rate. This throttles the amount of CPU and I/O that Auditbeat
  # consumes at startup while scanning. Default is "50 MiB".
  scan_rate_per_sec: 50 MiB

  # Limit on the size of files that will be hashed. Default is "100 MiB".
  # Limit on the size of files that will be hashed. Default is "100 MiB".
  max_file_size: 100 MiB

  # Hash types to compute when the file changes. Supported types are
  # blake2b_256, blake2b_384, blake2b_512, md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384,
  # sha512, sha512_224, sha512_256, sha3_224, sha3_256, sha3_384, sha3_512, and xxh64.
  # Default is sha1.
  hash_types: [sha1]

  # Detect changes to files included in subdirectories. Disabled by default.
  recursive: false

# =================================== Kibana ===================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
